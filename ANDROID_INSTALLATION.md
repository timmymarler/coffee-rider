# Coffee Rider - Android Installation Guide

This guide walks you through installing Coffee Rider on your Android device from Google Drive.

## Prerequisites

- Android device running Android 7.0 or higher
- Google Chrome or another web browser installed
- Enough storage space (approximately 150-200 MB)

## Step 1: Download the APK File

1. Open **Google Drive** on your Android device or visit the Coffee Rider download folder link in your browser
2. Locate the **Coffee Rider APK file** (look for a file ending in `.apk`)
3. Tap the **download icon** (↓) or select **Download**

### ⚠️ Warning: "This file type can harm your device"

Google Drive may show a warning: *"This file type can harm your device. Do you still want to download Coffee Rider.apk?"*

**This is normal and expected.** Android shows this warning for APK files downloaded from the web (not from the Play Store). Coffee Rider is safe—this is just a generic security precaution.

- Tap **Download anyway** to proceed

## Step 2: Allow Installation from Unknown Sources

After downloading, your Android device will prevent installation from unknown sources by default.

### Enable "Unknown Sources" or "Install Unknown Apps"

**For Android 8.0+:**
1. Open the notification or file manager where you downloaded the APK
2. Tap the file to install
3. Android will prompt: *"Google Play Protect: App not installed"* or *"Unknown app"*
4. Tap **Settings** → **Allow from this source** (or similar)
5. Return to the installer and tap **Install**

**For Android 7.x:**
1. Go to **Settings** → **Security** (or **Apps & Permissions**)
2. Enable **Unknown Sources** (toggle switch)
3. Confirm any additional warnings
4. Go to your file manager and tap the Coffee Rider APK file to install

## Step 3: Installation

1. When prompted, tap **Install**
2. Wait for the installation to complete (usually 15-30 seconds)
3. Once done, tap **Open** to launch Coffee Rider or **Done** to install without opening

### ⚠️ Warning: "Google Play Protect couldn't verify this app"

You may see: *"This app isn't verified by Google Play Protect."*

This is normal for apps installed outside the Play Store. Coffee Rider is safe to install.

- Tap **Install anyway** to continue

## Step 4: First Launch

1. Open Coffee Rider from your home screen or app drawer
2. Grant required permissions when prompted:
   - **Location**: Required for mapping and navigation
   - **Camera**: Required for café photo uploads
   - **Storage**: Required for saving routes and data
3. Log in with your Coffee Rider account (or create one)

## Permissions Explained

Coffee Rider requests the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Location** | To show your position on the map and calculate routes |
| **Camera** | To capture photos of cafés for your profile |
| **Storage** | To save downloaded maps and route data |
| **Contacts** | To create group rides with friends |
| **Notification** | To alert you about ride invitations and route updates |

**You can manage these permissions anytime** in Android Settings → Apps → Coffee Rider → Permissions.

## Troubleshooting

### "App not installed"
- Ensure you've enabled **Unknown Sources** (see Step 2)
- Try downloading again—the file may have been corrupted
- Check that you have at least 200 MB of free storage

### "Installation blocked"
- Your device's security settings are preventing installation
- Try enabling **Unknown Sources** in **Settings** → **Security**
- If using a work device, it may have additional restrictions

### App crashes on startup
- Uninstall and reinstall the APK
- Ensure you have the latest version from Google Drive
- Restart your device

### Location not working
- Go to **Settings** → **Apps** → **Coffee Rider** → **Permissions**
- Enable **Location** permission
- Set location to **"Precise" or "High accuracy"** mode

## Updating Coffee Rider

To update to a new version:
1. Download the latest APK from Google Drive (newer version will have a date or version number)
2. Tap the file and select **Install** (it will replace the older version)
3. No need to uninstall the old version first
